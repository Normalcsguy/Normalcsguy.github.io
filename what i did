Creating my Jalebi recipe blog and publishing it on GitHub Pages was both a rewarding and intricate process. To start, I created a GitHub repository named `Normalcsguy1.github.io`, which serves as the foundation for my site. This naming convention is crucial as GitHub Pages uses it to recognize and publish the repository as a website.

The next step was crafting the HTML file, which I meticulously designed to include the Jalebi recipe. This file contains the structure and content of my blog, from the main heading and introduction to the recipe details and images. I used HTML tags to organize the content, ensuring it was both readable and visually appealing.

To enhance the visual appeal, I applied custom CSS styling directly within the HTML file. This included setting a light blue background to match the theme, adjusting the font styles, and positioning images. For example, I placed a small Jalebi image on the top right corner of the page and adjusted its transparency for a subtle effect. The main image of the Jalebi and a smaller cooking image were displayed prominently, each resized for consistency in presentation.

After setting up the content and styling, I pushed these changes to my GitHub repository. GitHub Pages automatically detected the updates and built the site using the `main` branch of my repository. I made sure the site was correctly configured to publish from this branch by verifying the settings under the GitHub Pages section of my repository.

To make the site accessible, I configured a custom domain, but faced challenges due to misconfiguration. I resolved these by ensuring the domain was correctly set up and linked to my GitHub repository, as detailed in GitHub's documentation. 

Throughout this process, I learned a lot about web development and deployment, transforming my recipe into a living piece of digital content. I’m excited to share this blend of culinary passion and technical skills with you, hoping it not only provides a delicious recipe but also showcases the effort and love behind its creation. Creating my GitHub Pages site was a labor of love and dedication. After many hours of coding, designing, and refining my blog, I finally got it up and running, only to be faced with a frustrating challenge. Despite successfully setting up my repository named Normalcsguy1.github.io, I encountered a perplexing issue with configuring a custom domain. GitHub Pages has specific rules for custom domains, and I learned the hard way that certain domain endings, such as github.io, github.com, and others, are not permitted for custom use. My attempts to configure a custom domain were met with errors, as the domain I chose did not comply with GitHub's requirements. I meticulously checked my DNS settings, ensured my repository settings were correct, and consulted GitHub’s troubleshooting guides. Even so, the problem persisted, leaving me to navigate the complexities of domain configuration. This experience was a reminder of the intricate details involved in web development and the patience required to overcome technical obstacles. Despite the setbacks, I remain proud of the work I’ve put into this project and am eager to share it with others once the domain issues are resolved.
